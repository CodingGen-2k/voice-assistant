do we need on device asr or cloud based asr??


today 9 sept-

the code I have right now:
It records in 1-second chunks.
Keeps listening until either:
Max duration (30s) is reached, OR
Silence is detected for SILENCE_LIMIT chunks (default 5s) after speech has started.

That means:

If the user never speaks at all, it will still keep running for the full 30s (since the silence counter only starts after speech begins).
If the user speaks briefly (e.g., 3s) and then stops, it will detect silence for 5s â†’ exit after ~8s total.
If the user keeps talking, it will run until 30s hard stop.
